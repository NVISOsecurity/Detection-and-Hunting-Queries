# Detection and Hunting Queries

This repository contains detection and threat hunting queries created by NVISO’s CSIRT & SOC team. The queries are derived from handled incidents, threat hunts, trending threats, and other noteworthy activities observed in real-world investigations. 
While the queries currently focus on Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Endpoint, the underlying platforms may change in the future. The primary goal is to share a core detection logic that you can fine tune or extend to your own unique environment.

The content can be used in any way you like, although a reference to [@NVISO_Labs](https://x.com/NVISO_Labs) (X) or [NVISOsecurity](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/) (GitHub) would be much appreciated.
